AOI焊盘检测系统主要用于检测焊点焊接的外观质量，其核心用途涵盖以下方面：

检测焊接缺陷，保障基础质量-​常见焊点缺陷识别

检测多锡​（焊锡过量导致短路）、少锡​（焊锡不足影响导电性）、无锡​（完全未焊接）等焊接异常。
发现虚焊​（焊点接触不良）、短路​（相邻焊点粘连）、锡球​（残留颗粒）和浮起​（元件未贴合基板）等问题。
识别焊锡桥​（焊盘间非预期的锡膏连接）和焊盘重合不良​（锡膏与焊盘错位）等印刷缺陷。
​复杂焊接工艺监控

对高密度元件​（如0402以下微小元件）的焊点进行亚毫米级精度检测，解决人工目检效率低、漏检率高的问题。
支持异形元件​（如连接器、线圈）和精密封装​（如QFP、SOIC）的焊接质量评估。

English:

The AOI (Automatic Optical Inspection) pad detection system is mainly used to inspect the appearance quality of solder joint welding, and its core applications cover the following aspects:
Detecting Welding Defects and Ensuring Basic Quality - Identification of Common Solder Joint Defects
Detect welding abnormalities such as excess solder (short circuit caused by excessive solder), insufficient solder (poor conductivity due to insufficient solder), and no solder (complete lack of welding).
Identify issues like cold solder (poor contact of solder joints), short circuit (adhesion of adjacent solder joints), solder balls (residual particles), and lifting (components not 贴合 the substrate).
Recognize printing defects such as solder bridges (unexpected solder paste connections between pads) and poor pad alignment (misalignment between solder paste and pads).
Monitoring of Complex Welding Processes
Conduct sub - millimeter precision inspection on solder joints of high - density components (such as tiny components smaller than 0402), solving the problems of low efficiency and high missed detection rate in manual visual inspection.
Support welding quality evaluation of special - shaped components (such as connectors and coils) and precision packages (such as QFP and SOIC).
